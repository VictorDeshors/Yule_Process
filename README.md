# Random Numerical Simulations Around Rare Events on Yule Process

I made this project under the supervision of professors Arvind Singh.

I used variance reduction techniques that can be used in Monte Carlo methods, mainly importance sampling and splitting, to estimate probabilities of rare events. In addition, I simulated "typical" scenarios corresponding to those rare events (i.e., sampled from the conditional distribution).

The document [Proofs_Yule_process.pdf](Proofs_Yule_process.pdf) contains proofs for theoretical results about Yule processes.

You can run the notebook [YULE_PROCESS.ipynb](YULE_PROCESS.ipynb).

Some code was put in `.py` files in order to improve the clarity of [YULE_PROCESS.ipynb](YULE_PROCESS.ipynb).

All the code is available in this repository.
